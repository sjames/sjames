System and Software Architect for Embedded and Automotive systems, Amateur Radio Enthusiast (VU3CIN) and Sailor in training. An electronics and communication engineer who switched to writing embedded software as a career choice, but keeps in touch with electronics and communication by making it a hobby.

I use my personal github to publish my hobby projects and experiments in the hope that this will be useful for someone.

I'm currently trying to see where all I can program using the Rust programming language. I've taken a year off from the Corporate world to build something new, the Sabaton Platform. See https://developer.sabaton.dev
